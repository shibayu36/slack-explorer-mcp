# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version is supported with security updates.
Please always use the latest release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, report a vulnerability through GitHub's security advisory feature at https://github.com/shibayu36/slack-explorer-mcp/security/advisories/new.

You can expect an initial response within a few days. If for some reason you do not, please follow up with a comment on the advisory to ensure we received your original report.
